<p>In this episode we&rsquo;ll continue from last week and carry on looking at the internals of Rails 3&rsquo;s routing code. At the end of the last episode our application&rsquo;s routing file looked like this.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/config/routes.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">
Store::Application.routes.draw do
  match &#x27;products&#x27;, :to =&gt; ProductsController.action(&quot;index&quot;)
  match &#x27;products/recent&#x27;
end
</pre>

<p>Last time we showed the internals of the <code>match</code> method and showed what goes on when we call <code>match</code> in the routes file but there are a number of other methods that we can call and we&rsquo;ll take a look at some of them in this episode.</p>

<p>If we look in Rails 3.0&rsquo;s source code we&rsquo;ll find the routing logic in the <code>actionpack/lib/actiondispatch/routing</code> directory and we&rsquo;ll be focussing on the <code>Mapper</code> class in this directory because, as we discussed last time, the block inside the routes file is scoped to this class. This means that any methods called within the block are called against an instance of <code>Mapper</code> and we can therefore call any of <code>Mapper</code>&rsquo;s methods in our routes file.</p>

<p>The code in the <code>Mapper</code> class can be a little overwhelming. The code is long, at almost 1,000 lines, and complex but the good news is that this is the longest file related to routing in Rails so if you can grasp what&rsquo;s going on in this file and understand how it works then you&rsquo;ll have a pretty good idea as to how routing works in Rails.</p>

<p>In order to get a good overview of the code we&rsquo;ll collapse it down using the code-folding facility in TextMate.  Pressing <code>Command-Option-0</code> will fold everything. We&rsquo;ll then expand the root module <code>ActionDispatch</code>, its submodule <code>Routing</code> and finally the <code>Mapping</code> class itself to get an overview of its structure.</p>

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="/system/photos/474/original/E232I01.png" width="732" height="798" alt="The structure of the Mapper class."/>
</div>

<p>The first two items in the <code>Mapper</code> class are class definitions for <code>Constraints</code> and <code>Mapping</code>. We touched on both of these in the last episode but what&rsquo;s worth noticing here is that the classes are nested under the <code>Mapper</code> class. This might seem strange if you&rsquo;re new to Ruby and you could well be wondering why you&rsquo;d nest classes like this. There&rsquo;s no magic going on behind the scenes here; the <code>Constraints</code> class is completely separate from the <code>Mapper</code> class. The reason this is done is that nesting the classes defines the namespace for the <code>Constraints</code> and <code>Mapping</code> classes so that they will appear under the <code>Mapper</code> namespace. There&rsquo;s no inheritance or shared behaviour when you nest classes like this in Ruby.</p> 

<p>Moving down the class we have two class methods, <code>self.normalize_path</code> and <code>self.normalize_name</code>. These are utility methods that are used throughout the class. Below that is a set of modules:</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">rails/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/routing/mapper.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">
module Base...

module HttpHelpers...

module Scoping...

module Resources...

module Shorthand...

include Base
include HttpHelpers
include Scoping
include Resources
include Shorthand
</pre>

<p>These five modules are included into the <code>Mapper</code> class. The code in them is placed in modules merely as a way to organize the code in the class.</p> 

<h3>Base</h3>

<p>We looked at the first module, <code>Base</code>, in the last episode. It contains the <code>match</code> method, the <code>root</code> method that uses <code>match</code>, and also a <code>mount</code> method that provides another way to map a Rack application to a URL.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">rails/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/routing/mapper.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">
module Base
  def initialize(set) #:nodoc:

  def root(options = {})
    match &#x27;/&#x27;, options.reverse_merge(:as =&gt; :root)
  end

  def match(path, options=nil)...

  def mount(app, options = nil)...

  def default_url_options=(options)...
  alias_method :default_url_options, :default_url_options=
end
</pre>

<h3>HttpHelpers</h3>

<p>The next module is <code>HttpHelpers</code> and this is where the <code>get</code>, <code>post</code>, <code>put</code> and <code>delete</code> methods are defined. These methods are used to map routes to certain types of requests.</p> 

<p class="codeFilePath">rails/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/routing/mapper.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">
module HttpHelpers
  def get(*args, &amp;block)
    map_method(:get, *args, &amp;block)
  end

  def post(*args, &amp;block)
    map_method(:post, *args, &amp;block)
  end

  def put(*args, &amp;block)
    map_method(:put, *args, &amp;block)
  end

  def delete(*args, &amp;block)
    map_method(:delete, *args, &amp;block)
  end

  def redirect(*args, &amp;block)...

  private
  def map_method(method, *args, &amp;block)
     options = args.extract_options!
     options[:via] = method
     args.push(options)
     match(*args, &amp;block)
     self
   end
end
</pre>

<p>All of these methods call the private <code>map_method</code> method. This method sets the <code>:via</code> option according to the method passed in and then calls <code>match</code>. You&rsquo;ll notice in the routing code that a lot of the methods delegate to the <code>match</code> method, passing in and customizing certain options beforehand. So if we only want a route to respond to a GET request we could do it this way, using the via option.</p>

<pre class="ruby">
match &#x27;products/recent&#x27;, :via =&gt; :get
</pre>

<p>In practice we&rsquo;d do this by using the shorter <code>get</code> method, which will create a route with the same option.</p>

<pre class="ruby">
get &#x27;products/recent&#x27;
</pre>

<p>The <code>post</code>, <code>put</code> and <code>delete</code> methods work in much the same way as the get method for the other request types. The <code>redirect</code> method, however, is interesting as it is very different from the others and returns a Rack application.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">rails/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/routing/mapper.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">
def redirect(*args, &amp;block)
  options = args.last.is_a?(Hash) ? args.pop : {}

  path      = args.shift || block
  path_proc = path.is_a?(Proc) ? path : proc { |params| path % params }
  status    = options[:status] || 301

  lambda do |env|
    req = Request.new(env)

    params = [req.symbolized_path_parameters]
    params &lt;&lt; req if path_proc.arity &gt; 1

    uri = URI.parse(path_proc.call(*params))
    uri.scheme ||= req.scheme
    uri.host   ||= req.host
    uri.port   ||= req.port unless req.standard_port?

    body = %(&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;You are being &lt;a href=&quot;#{ERB::Util.h(uri.to_s)}&quot;&gt;redirected&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;)

    headers = {
      &#x27;Location&#x27; =&gt; uri.to_s,
      &#x27;Content-Type&#x27; =&gt; &#x27;text/html&#x27;,
      &#x27;Content-Length&#x27; =&gt; body.length.to_s
    }

    [ status, headers, [body] ]
  end
end
</pre>

<p>The method returns Rack application by returning an array comprised of a status, some headers and a body. The status defaults to <code>301</code> which will make the browser perform a simple <code>301 Moved Permanently</code> redirect. We can use this <code>redirect</code> method directly inside our routes file if we want one URL to redirect to another.  In our routes file we already have a route that uses the <code>:to</code> parameter and this parameter takes a Rack application.</p>

<pre class="ruby">
match &#x27;products&#x27;, :to =&gt; ProductsController.action(&quot;index&quot;)
</pre>

<p>As the <code>redirect</code> option returns a Rack app we can use it here to redirect to a new URL like this:</p>

<pre class="ruby">
match &#x27;products&#x27;, :to =&gt; redirect(&quot;/items&quot;)
</pre>

<p>This feature becomes really useful when you&rsquo;re changing the URLs in your application but still want to support legacy URLs. You can use redirect to <code>redirect</code> these to their new equivalents.</p>

<h3>Shorthand</h3>

<p>The next modules listed are <code>Scoping</code> and <code>Resources</code> but we&rsquo;ll come back to those shortly. Instead we&rsquo;ll take a look at the <code>Shorthand</code> module. This is an interesting module that redefines the <code>match</code> method, which was defined back in the <code>Base</code> module. This <code>match</code> method supports a different syntax for the options that you can pass to it. The shorthand method is an alternative way to write the <code>:to</code> option in a route such as the <code>redirect</code> route we wrote above.</p>

<pre class="ruby">
match &#x27;products&#x27;, :to =&gt; redirect(&#x27;/items&#x27;)
</pre>

<p>This is a common thing to do in a routes file and the shorthand method lets us write the route with a simple hash made up of the route and whatever that route should point to. As with the full route syntax we can append parameters to the end of the route.</p>

<pre class="ruby">
match &#x27;products&#x27; =&gt; redirect(&#x27;/items&#x27;)
</pre>

<p><code>Shorthand</code>&rsquo;s match method sets the <code>:to</code> parameter when it isn&rsquo;t already set. It then calls <code>super</code> but as <code>Mapper</code> doesn&rsquo;t inherit from another class what does <code>super</code> call in this case?</p>

<p class="ruby">rails/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/routing/mapper.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">
module Shorthand
  def match(*args)
    if args.size == 1 &amp;&amp; args.last.is_a?(Hash)
      options  = args.pop
      path, to = options.find { |name, value| name.is_a?(String) }
      options.merge!(:to =&gt; to).delete(path)
      super(path, options)
    else
      super
    end
  end
end
</pre>

<p>When we use <code>super</code> like this Ruby will look for a method with the same name that was defined in an earlier module. The <code>Shorthand</code> module is defined last in the list of modules that are included in <code>Mapper</code> so Ruby will look through the earlier modules for a <code>match</code> method and delegate to that. In this case it will call <code>match</code> in the Base module.</p>

<p>This technique is used often in the Rails 3 source code. Earlier versions of Rails used <code>alias_method_chain</code> to override specific behaviour, but now in Rails 3 we can just use <code>super</code>.</p>

<h3>Resources</h3>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for the <code>Shorthand</code> module; next we&rsquo;ll take a look at <code>Resources</code>. As you&rsquo;d expect this module contains the <code>resources</code> method and all of its associated methods. We use <code>resources</code> in our routes file to create RESTful routes.</p> 

<p class="codeFilePath">rails/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/routing/mapper.rb</p>

<pre class="ruby">
def resources(*resources, &amp;block)
  options = resources.extract_options!

  if apply_common_behavior_for(:resources, resources, options, &amp;block)
    return self
  end

  resource_scope(Resource.new(resources.pop, options)) do
    yield if block_given?

    collection_scope do
      get  :index if parent_resource.actions.include?(:index)
      post :create if parent_resource.actions.include?(:create)
    end

    new_scope do
      get :new
    end if parent_resource.actions.include?(:new)

    member_scope  do
      get    :edit if parent_resource.actions.include?(:edit)
      get    :show if parent_resource.actions.include?(:show)
      put    :update if parent_resource.actions.include?(:update)
      delete :destroy if parent_resource.actions.include?(:destroy)
    end
  end

  self
end
</pre>

<p>This method is fairly complex but if you look at the general structure of it it makes sense. There are a couple of collection methods, <code>get :index</code> and <code>post :create</code>; there is a <code>get :new</code> method and finally <code>get :edit</code>, <code>get :show</code>, <code>put :update</code> and <code>delete :destroy</code>. You should recognize these as the famous seven RESTful actions and these are created for a controller when you call resources on it in the routes file.</p> 

<p>Note the first line in the method&rsquo;s <code>resource_scope</code> block. If a block is passed to the method then the method will <code>yield</code> to that block before it creates the RESTful actions. This gives us the ability to create our own actions in the routes file. For example we could add a new collection route that returns the discounted products.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/config/routes.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">
Store::Application.routes.draw do
  match &#x27;products&#x27;, :to =&gt; redirect(&#x27;/items&#x27;)
  get &#x27;products/recent&#x27;
  resources :products do
    collection do:
      get :discounted
    end
  end
end
</pre>

<p>The code inside the block passed to <code>resources</code> in the routes above will be executed by the <code>yield</code> call in <code>resource_scope</code> and the standard RESTful actions will be defined afterwards. We can use similar code in the block above to that in the resources method in the Rails source code to define our custom actions.</p>

<p>Looking at the blocks in the routes file above you might think that the object is changing every time we create a new block but this isn&rsquo;t the case. We&rsquo;re still working with the same <code>Mapper</code> object we worked with in the beginning so calling <code>get</code> in the innermost blocks is exactly the same as calling it in the outermost. We are dealing with a different scope, though, and we&rsquo;ll discuss scopes shortly.</p>

<p>If you take another look back at the <code>resources</code> method from Rails&rsquo; source code you&rsquo;ll see that the code uses a <code>collection_scope</code> call when it defines the <code>index</code> and <code>create</code> actions but inside our routes file we just use <code>collection</code>. What&rsquo;s the difference? Well, not much. If we look at the <code>collection</code> method in the <code>Mapper</code> class we&rsquo;ll see that it delegates to <code>collection_scope</code>.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">rails/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/routing/mapper.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">
def collection
  unless @scope[:scope_level] == :resources
    raise ArgumentError, &quot;can&#x27;t use collection outside resources scope&quot;
  end

  collection_scope do
    yield
  end
end
</pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take another quick look at our routes file.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/config/routes.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">
Store::Application.routes.draw do
  match &#x27;products&#x27;, :to =&gt; redirect(&#x27;/items&#x27;)
  get &#x27;products/recent&#x27;
  resources :products do
    collection do:
      get :discounted
    end
  end
end
</pre>

<p>Both calls to get in the code above call the same method but the one inside the <code>collection</code> block will assume some additional behaviour according to how it is scoped inside the <code>resources</code> and <code>collection</code> blocks.</p>

<p>If we take a look back in the <code>Resources</code> module we&rsquo;ll see a familiar-looking method, <code>match</code>. This redefines the <code>match</code> method and adds some additional behaviour based on resources.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">rails/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/routing/mapper.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">
def match(*args)
  options = args.extract_options!.dup
  options[:anchor] = true unless options.key?(:anchor)

  if args.length &gt; 1
    args.each { |path| match(path, options.dup) }
    return self
  end

  on = options.delete(:on)
  if VALID_ON_OPTIONS.include?(on)
    args.push(options)
    return send(on){ match(*args) }
  elsif on
    raise ArgumentError, &quot;Unknown scope #{on.inspect} given to :on&quot;
  end

  if @scope[:scope_level] == :resources
    args.push(options)
    return nested { match(*args) }
  elsif @scope[:scope_level] == :resource
    args.push(options)
    return member { match(*args) }
  end

  action = args.first
  path = path_for_action(action, options.delete(:path))

  if action.to_s =~ /^[\w\/]+$/
    options[:action] ||= action unless action.to_s.include?(&quot;/&quot;)
    options[:as] = name_for_action(action, options[:as])
  else
    options[:as] = name_for_action(options[:as])
  end

  super(path, options)
end
</pre>

<p>If we look about halfway down the code above you&rsquo;ll see the line that checks the current scope to see if it is <code>resources</code>. If it is some different behaviour is added. The logic is fairly complex; all you need to know is that the <code>Resources</code> module redefines the <code>match</code> method. Note that at the end it calls <code>super</code> so that the <code>match</code> method in <code>Base</code> is called. Remember that <code>get</code> calls <code>match</code> and this is where the additional functionality is located for dealing with <code>get</code> and other methods that are defined within <code>resources</code>.</p>

<h3>Scoping</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re now down to the last method in our <code>Mapping</code> class: <code>Scoping</code>. Whenever there&rsquo;s a block inside your routes file there&rsquo;s a call to <code>Scoping</code>&rsquo;s <code>scope</code> behind the scenes. That means that it will define some additional behaviour for the code inside that block.</p> 

<p>Along with the scope method there are a number of other methods, all of which delegate to <code>scope</code>.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">rails/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/routing/mapper.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">
def initialize(*args) #:nodoc:
  @scope = {}
  super
end

def controller(controller, options={})
  options[:controller] = controller
  scope(options) { yield }
end

def namespace(path, options = {})
  path = path.to_s
  options = { :path =&gt; path, :as =&gt; path, :module =&gt; path,
              :shallow_path =&gt; path, :shallow_prefix =&gt; 			path }.merge!(options)
  scope(options) { yield }
end

def constraints(constraints = {})
  scope(:constraints =&gt; constraints) { yield }
end

def defaults(defaults = {})
  scope(:defaults =&gt; defaults) { yield }
end
</pre>

<p>These methods are all fairly simple and all delegate to a more generic method having first set some options. For example <code>defaults</code> calls <code>scope</code> after setting some <code>defaults</code> options. and likewise <code>constraints</code> calls scope with some <code>constraints</code> options. The <code>namespace</code> method is a little more complex but does essentially the same thing.  The module also has an <code>initialize</code> method which just creates a <code>@scope</code> instance variable and sets it to be an empty hash. You might be wondering what an <code>initialize</code> method is doing here as modules can&rsquo;t be instantiated. This is true, but in this case we&rsquo;re just overriding a method behaviour. When the <code>Scoping</code> module is included in the <code>Mapper</code> class this <code>initialize</code> method will override the current <code>initialize</code> method, add the <code>@scope</code> variable and then call <code>super</code>.</p> 

<p>Finally we have the <code>scope</code> method itself and this is where all of the work takes place. There&rsquo;s a lot of complexity in this method but all it is essentially doing is filling up the <code>@scope</code> variable with some information based on the options that are being passed into the scope. The method merges the options using the a number of  private methods in the module. All it does is store up the scope information so that it can be used later on inside whatever match call you have. Essentially it adds additional functionality based on the current scope.</p> 

<p>That&rsquo;s basically how blocks inside the routes file work. If we define routes like this:</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/config/routes.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">
Store::Application.routes.draw do
  controller :products do
    match #...
  end  
end
</pre>

<p>Whenever we call <code>match</code> in the <code>controller</code> block above (and remember it delegates to <code>scope</code>) the <code>controller</code> option will automatically be supplied in there.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for this episode. I hope it&rsquo;s given you some idea what&rsquo;s the methods inside the routes file are doing. Even though you have a large number of methods to choose from in the routes file most of them are really simple delegating to either match or scope passing in some additional options.</p>
